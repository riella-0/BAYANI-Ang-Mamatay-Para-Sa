> *“A reimagining of Philippine history through the lens of sacrifice, struggle, and the Filipino spirit.”*

---

## 📖 **Overview**

**BAYANI: Ang Mamatay Para Sa…** is a 3D third-person action-adventure prototype developed in Unity.
Players experience the final moments of iconic Filipino heroes — *Andres Bonifacio, Lapu-Lapu, and Benigno “Ninoy” Aquino Jr.* — from multiple perspectives.
Each level combines stylized low-poly art with cinematic storytelling and moral reflection on what it means to die for one’s country.
